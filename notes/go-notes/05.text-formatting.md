## Recall

- What is the difference between single quotes, double quotes, and backticks in Go?
- How do you print a float with two decimal places using Go?
- What is the purpose of `fmt.Printf` and what are format specifiers?
- How do `fmt.Sprintf`, `fmt.Sprint`, and `fmt.Sprintln` differ from `fmt.Print`?
- When would you use backticks instead of double quotes to define a string?

## Notes

### Outputting

To output a value in Go, you can use the `fmt.Print` or `fmt.Printl` functions, as shown previously:

```go
bar := "bar"
fmt.Println("Foo", bar)
// Foo bar
```

As in C, Java, and C#, you use double quotes for printing strings. Single quotes are typically used for individual characters. Another way to print text is by using backticks (`), which allow you to preserve line breaks and formatting

```go
bar := "bar"
fmt.Println(`Foo
`, bar)
//    Foo
// bar
```

### Formatting

When printing floating-point numbers, for example, it's often useful to control the number of decimal places for better readability. Go provides `fmt.Printf` for that purpose:

```go
bar := 193.3215
fmt.Printf("Foo %.2f", bar)
// Foo 193.3215
```

Similar to C, `fmt.Printf` uses [format specifiers](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) (also called verbs) to define how values should be displayed. `%f` is the standard format for floating-point numbers, but there are many more

If you need to create a formatted string, you can use `fmt.Sprint`. This allows you to generate a formatted string and print it later, without formatting it directly in `fmt.Print`. The `fmt` package also provides variations like `Sprintln` and `Sprintf`, which work similarly to their `Print` counterparts:

```go
value := 193.3215
bar := fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", value)
fmt.Println("Foo", bar)
// Foo 193.32
```

## Summary

In Go, values are printed using the `fmt.Print` and `fmt.Println` functions. Strings are enclosed in double quotes, while single quotes are used for individual characters. Backticks can also be used to preserve line breaks and formatting. For floating-point numbers, `fmt.Printf` allows control over decimal places using format specifiers, such as `%.2f` to display two decimal places. If you need to create a formatted string without printing it immediately, you can use `fmt.Sprint`, `fmt.Sprintf`, or `fmt.Sprintln`, which work similarly to their `Print` counterparts but return the formatted string instead of displaying it directly
