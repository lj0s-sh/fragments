## Recall

- What is the difference between `fmt.Print` and `fmt.Println`?
- How does `fmt.Scan` store the user’s input into a variable?
- What are the limitations of `fmt.Scan` when reading input?
- Which package should be used for handling more complex or multi-line input?

## Notes

### IO

In Go, IO operations are handled by the `fmt` package, which provides most of the functions responsible for inputting and outputting data. 

To output data, you can use `fmt.Printl` or `fmt.Println`:

```go
fmt.Print("Hello, ")
fmt.Println("World!")
// Hello, World!
```

The only difference between them is that `fmt.Println` adds a new line after printing the message.

To take a value as input from the user, you can use `fmt.Scan`:

```go
var name string
fmt.Print("User name: ")
fmt.Scan(&name)
fmt.Println("Hello,"name)
```

Similar to C’s `scanf`, `fmt.Scan` uses pointers to assign the input value to the variable. To use pointers, you need to pass the address of the variable with the `&` symbol. 

While `fmt.Scan` is a good option for simple input, it has limitations when dealing with multiple words or phrases containing spaces. To handle this, `fmt.Scanln` can be used, as it reads input until a newline is encountered. For more complex input, especially with multiple lines, the `bufio` package can be used to handle input more efficiently:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	fmt.Print("Enter your message: ")
	input, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
	fmt.Println("You wrote:", input)
}
```

## Summary

Go uses the `fmt` package for basic input and output. `fmt.Print` and `fmt.Println` print data to the console, with `Println` adding a newline. For user input, `fmt.Scan` and `fmt.Scanln` are used, relying on pointers to store values. For more flexible or multi-line input, the `bufio` package is recommended.
