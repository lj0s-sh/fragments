## Recall

- How do you declare a variable and a constant in Go?
- What is the difference between `var` and `:=`?
- What are the most common data types in Go?
- What is a `rune` and when is it used?
- What does `nil` represent in Go?
- Can multiple variables be declared in one line using shorthand?

## Notes

### Variables and Constants

Variables in Go work as they do in any other language: they store values. To declare a variable, use the `var` keyword:

```go
var foo = "bar"
```

You also can declare multiple variables on the same line:

```go
var foo, bar, year = "foo", "bar", 2025
```

Constants are fixed-value variables that cannot be modified after assignment (similar to other programming languages again). To declare a constant, use the `const` keyword:

```go
const birthDate = "01/01/1999"
```

Itâ€™s common to declare constants globally. To do that, just create your constant above the main function:

```go
const pi = 3.14

func main() {
	// ...
}
```

Variables and constants names follow the `camelCase` convention.

### Data types

A variable (and a constant) can assume multiple data types, but these are the most common:

- `int`
- `float64`
- `string`
- `bool`

Other more specific Go types include:

- `rune`: An alias to int32, used to represent single unicode characters
- `nil`: Go alternative for `null` type, assigned as default value to variables that are not explicity initialized

**Go infers the data type** based on the **assigned value**:

```go
var randomText = "place something" // string
var randomNum = 43 // int
var randomFloat = 53.1 // float64
var randomChar = 'a' // rune as an alias to int32
var randomBool = false // bool
```

To explicitly define a type, specify it after the variable name

```go
// Even if its a integer value, Go will treat this variable as float64
var randomNum float64 = 43
```

If the inferred type is correct, you can use the shorthand syntax `:=` without `var`:

```go
year := 2025 // int
```

You can also declare multiple variables using this shorthand, but all variables must have the same inferred type:

```go
day, month, year := 22, 6, 2025
```

## Summary

Go uses `var` to declare variables and `const` for constants. Type inference is automatic but can be made explicit. You can also use `:=` as shorthand for declaring and initializing variables. Common types include `int`, `float64`, `string`, `bool`, and `rune`. Variables follow camelCase naming, and constants are often declared globally.
