## Recall

- What is SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)?
- How does SSRF differ from CSRF?
- What conditions make SSRF possible?
- What are common targets in SSRF attacks?
- How can internal network resources be exposed through SSRF?

## Notes

### What it is

**SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)** is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary locations, both internal and external, on behalf of the attacker.

Unlike CSRF, SSRF does not require any interaction from the user â€” the server itself becomes the victim, sending requests as instructed by the attacker. SSRF can be used to:

- Access internal services behind firewalls
- Interact with cloud metadata endpoints
- Perform port scanning from the server
- Bypass IP-based access controls
- Exfiltrate sensitive information

### How to identify it

Look for any functionality that makes server-side requests based on user-controlled input, such as:

- Image loading and processing
- URL previews (link unfurling)
- File downloads or imports
- API integrations

Typical URL parameters may look like:

```bash
https://target.com/form?server=https://api.target.com
```

Or sometimes less obvious:

```bash
https://target.com/form?server=api
```

Or a bit more tricky

```bash
https://target.com/item/9?server=api -> https://api.target.com/item/9
```

Since the behavior of a SSRF is to make the server make a request to whatever the attacker wants, to find one you can search for any parameters in form tags on the source code

### How to exploit it

Once you confirm SSRF, you can attempt:

- **Internal network enumeration:**
    
    Replace the URL with internal IPs like `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` or `http://10.0.0.5/admin`.
    
- **Cloud metadata exploitation:**
    
    On cloud providers, try endpoints like:
    
    ```bash
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
    ```
    
- **Port scanning via SSRF:**
    
    Modify the URL parameter to scan internal ports:
    
    ```bash
    http://127.0.0.1:22
    http://127.0.0.1:3306
    ```
    

## Summary

**SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)** allows attackers to make the server issue requests to arbitrary destinations, potentially accessing internal resources inaccessible from outside. Unlike CSRF, SSRF targets the server itself, not the end-user browser. Exploitation may lead to internal network discovery, credential theft (via metadata APIs), bypass of network segmentation, and sometimes even Remote Code Execution if the internal services are vulnerable.

Prevention involves strict allow-listing of external destinations, disabling unnecessary outbound requests, validating user input strictly, and isolating internal services from external web-facing components.
