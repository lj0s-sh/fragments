Give Up - Low Roar | 22 May 2025

Today is a promising day. It's a chance to look at something old with new eyes.

I've always wanted to get into OffSec, but I've never dedicated enough time to it. I've never felt smart enough, but the stability with which I've been leading my life is pushing me over the edge.

I need a new path, and this is the one I've chosen. It's ironic that I'm looking for something new in something so old. Buried deep inside.

This is the beginning of my search. Don't give up on me.
