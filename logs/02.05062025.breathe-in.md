Breathe In - Low Roar | 08 Jun. 2025

OffSec is very different from what I imagined. Well, quite different. I confess that I've been considering whether this area is really for me.

So much to study, so much to discover. The labs are much more difficult than I imagined. I often find myself completely lost having to consult the write-up and, almost always, discovering that the answer is in my face the whole time.

Another thing I've noticed is that nobody explains anything to you. In fact, the lab is designed to hide as many details as possible. And sometimes, the solution is in the details.

Maybe I'm rushing something that, by its nature, is slow, time-consuming and sometimes tedious. The fun of hacking something is not the result, but the process. But what happens when you try to rush the process? You get lost, frustrated, annoyed and left with the feeling that you're not fit for the job.

Maybe I should take a few steps back. Breathe in.
