> When the walls are caving in my head

This is a collection of artifacts from my journey through offensive security.  
Inside you'll find:

- ðŸ“„ Articles â€” deeper explorations into security topics  
- ðŸ““ Notes â€” technical findings, patterns, breakdowns  
- ðŸª¶ Essays â€” raw reflections on smaller topics

Each file is a trace â€” not a polished endpoint.  
This repository is not a manual. Itâ€™s a breadcrumb trail.
