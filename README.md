> _When the walls are caving in my head_  
> _When the dream controls my attitude_

This is a collection of artifacts from my journey through offensive security.  
Inside you'll find:
 
- ðŸª¶ **Essays** â€” raw reflections on smaller topics 
- ðŸ““ **Notes** â€” technical findings and scattered knowledge  
- ðŸ“‘ **Logs** â€” fragments from my learning process, daily struggles, and progress

Each file is a trace â€” not a polished endpoint.  
This repository is not a manual. Itâ€™s a breadcrumb trail.

This repository exists primarily for personal use.  
It is public because I believe that fragments, when shared,  
can become light for others walking similar paths.  

If something here breaks, is wrong, or is incomplete â€” thatâ€™s expected.  
It simply means the journey isnâ€™t over yet.
